# Phi-2 Fine Tuner README

## Welcome
Welcome to the Phi-2 Fine Tuner, a specialized tool for fine-tuning Microsoft's Phi-2 AI language model. This project provides a streamlined approach for enhancing the capabilities of the Phi-2 model right on your local machine.

## Overview
Our tool is specifically designed to interact with the Phi-2 model, focusing on simplicity and efficiency. It includes features for easy data processing, robust logging, advanced error handling, and flexible training functionalities.

## Program Updates
- **Data Processing**: Integrated with `load_dataset` for efficient data handling compatible with Phi-2.
- **Logging**: Upgraded logging for better tracking and debugging.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for Phi-2 model intricacies.
- **Training Functionality**: Advanced `train_model` function for efficient management of Phi-2 model training.

## Usage
- **Model Initialization**: Initialize the Phi-2 model from a specified directory.
- **Data Input**: GUI interface for selecting text files for training.
- **Training Controls**: Adjust parameters like learning rate and batch size, and manage training with a loss threshold.
- **Precision Control**: Choose between FP16 and FP32 for efficient resource management.
  
## Important Notes
